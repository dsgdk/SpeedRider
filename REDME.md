# Speed Rider

This project consists of code for an Arduino Mega-based robot equipped with 11 sensors and a servo motor. The main goal of this bot is to follow a black line with maximum precision and speed. The robot with this code won first place at the RoboTraffic international competition in 2021.

## Requirements

- Arduino Mega
- Servo motors
- 11 sensors

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dsgdk/SpeedRider.git
    ```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

**Configuration**:
- **DEBUG_RIDER**    - UART
- **FAST_START**     - initial seconds of running at maximum speed (HIGH)
- **GREEN_START**    - start if the green traffic light is on
- **ALGORITHM_TIME** - option to change the botâ€™s speed at specific sections of the track

- **ZERO_POS** - middle position of the servo (programmatically 90 degrees is not always mechanically 90. This setting allows manual adjustment to exactly 90 degrees)
- **MAX_SERVO_ANGLE** - maximum servo deviation

- **MAX_MOTOR_SPEED** - maximum speed
- **MIN_MOTOR_SPEED** - minimum speed

- **TOTAL_SENSORS** - total number of sensors
